## [Unreleased]

Work to appear in upcoming releases:

- Multi Board support easily user configurable
- More advanced PWM algorithm yielding better brightness control
- I've even some fun animated clocks coming (sorry, I'm been doing software clocks of many, many, forms for a long time.)

## [1.0.0] 2020-12-03

### Initial Release - Single Panel

- Single panel support working well, up to 2048 leds (64x32)
- PWM'ing images to achieve reasonable color
- Displaying text in both 5x7 and 8x8 fonts
- Initial version of scrolling text - will get more performant in future updates
- Basic color pixel placement at row, column
- Basic drawing primitives
- Loading and displaying images from .bmp files (that are identically sized to your panel)


## History: Progress heading toward initial release

**30 Nov 2020:** After being distracted by designing and sourcing the Eval Adapter boards I'm finally working on the driver once again.

- rundimentary scrolling text is now working
- multiple panel types are now supported (will add more as users identify the need)


**20 Oct 2020:** I've made wonderful advances in this past week.

Things now working are:

- Loading and displaying images from .bmp files
- PWMing images to achieve reasonable color (initial draft)
- Displaying text in both 5x7 and 8x8 fonts

Here you can see a demonstration of the 16-bit pwm color. Of course these panels are amazingly bright. I'm running here at ~50% brightness and it's still overwhelming the camera in a lighted room.


**27 Oct 2020:** More engineering and the boards arrive!

This week I've been:

- Working to formally structure the code for release
- Studied gamma correction and now have a better performing table in place
- Studied PWM for the LEDs and now have a much more accurate PWM in place (colors are looking much better)
- Have been working on more tests, demos for animation rates of display
- More videos will be coming, meanwhile, have you seen these? [YouTube Playlist for Propeller Related Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkXxMjp58T0pk1dd8pH1OV7NCf-8Tbx1M)
- **Exciting!** The initial run of the Adapter PCBs arrived!
- I checked them out mechanically, soldered the parts to one, then checked it out electrically and lastly started using it!  It came up beautifully! (*See pictures and turn on description below*)
