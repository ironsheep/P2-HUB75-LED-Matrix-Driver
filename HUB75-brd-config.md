# P2 Eval HUB75 Adaptor Board

## Use of optional connectors (Rev 1.2 red & 1.3 green)
The optional connectors allow you to use monitor the signals output to the HUB75 connector by the P2 driver.  J4 and J5 allow access to the 2 pins not being used to drive the HUB75 devices.  While J3 allows one to fully monitor all signals at the HUB75 connector. Just connect high-impedance probes to monitor.

You likely received a small bag of header pins cut specifically so they can be soldered at these locations should you wish to use J3, J4 or J5.

## Connecting your board

The HUB75 adapter board is compatible with both the P2 Eval board and the new P2 Edge Board.  Simply choose a connector-pair then attach the board. Lastly you'll need to configure the driver so it knows which connector-pair to use. See [Driver Configuration Details](THEOPS.md)
