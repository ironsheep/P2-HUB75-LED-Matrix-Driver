# Bench run notes

**Class: append-only log.** Written by the executing (macOS + hardware) side.
Never pruned and never re-cut. The authoring side reads it and does not edit it.
Each hand-back adds one dated entry with three parts: tree state (scoped to
`driver/*.spin2`), the observation rather than a verdict, and which steps completed.
